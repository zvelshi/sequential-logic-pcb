## #️ Sequential Logic PCB

In this project, a complex electronic circuit was developed with the primary goal of creating a finite-state machine capable of cycling through a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) encoding of a unique 10-digit value. The project involved several stages of design, optimization, testing, and final implementation.
